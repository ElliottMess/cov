## To do

* switch data source to ECDC?
* add shiny interface
* compute and chart moving window weekly case increase averages
* add deaths and recovered cases
* labels

   * explicitly add x-label for the most recent date
   * title, description, data source, etc
   * do something about verical grids and x-labels, show weeks more clearly
   
* add a "days since first case" metric as an alternative x-axis to actual date
* add a "timeshift" tool so you can move one country to compare how many days behind another country it is
